# Integrated-Islamic-Ontology
<h3> This repository offers the **integrated Islamic ontology**, a systematically organised bilingual Arabic-English framework of knowledge derived from Islamic sources, including the Qurâ€™an and Hadith. 
This ontology was developed to unify multiple Quranic and Hadith resources, inclusding [QacSegment](http://textminingthequran.com/data/QacSegment.json), QuranOntology, [LK-Hadith corpus](https://github.com/ShathaTm/LK-Hadith-Corpus), related Quran-Hadith topics based on the related Quran-verse and Hadith-teachings in the [QH_Dataset](https://github.com/ShathaTm/Quran_Hadith_Datasets/blob/main/QH_Dataset.csv), and the generated topics from [HTT](https://github.com/Ibtisam-a/Hadith-Topics-using-GPT4/blob/main/Hadith-Teaching-Topics_HTT.xlsx). It provided a semantic framewrok for analysing and retrieving Islamic texts.
